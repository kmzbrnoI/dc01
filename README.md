DCC cutter DC-01
================

DC-01 is a DCC-cutting device. It can dis/connect low-power DCC cable. DC-01 is
connected to a PC via USB. Its purpose is to serve as a safety device – DC-01
monitors railroad control software running on the PC. When software
malfunctions (no data are received from the SW for some time), DC-01 cuts DCC
so all the trains operated by the malfunctioning SW are immediately stopped.

This project contains both PCB manufacturing data and firmware for PCB's MCU.
